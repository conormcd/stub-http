# fake-http

A Clojure library designed to fake HTTP responses regardless of which library used to actually make the HTTP requests.
  
There are several library specific "http faking" libraries out there such as [clj-http-fake](https://github.com/myfreeweb/clj-http-fake) and 
[ring-mock](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-mock) but they won't work unless you're using a specific library. I couldn't find a library agnostic library for 
faking HTTP responses so I sat out to write one myself based on [nanohttpd](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd). This is useful
if you want to test your app against a "real" HTTP server with actual HTTP requests. And even if you don't _want_ to this it may be your only
option if you're (for example) is using a Java library that makes HTTP requests and you want to fake its responses.

More docs and implementation is coming soon.

## Usage

```clojure
(with-routes! 
	{"something" {:status 200 :content-type "application/json" :body (json/generate-string {:hello "world"})}
	 {:path "/y" :query {:q "something")}} {:status 200 :content-type "application/json" :body  (json/generate-string {:hello "brave new world"})}}
	 ; Do actual HTTP request
	 )
```
